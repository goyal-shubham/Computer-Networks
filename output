SANTA CLARA -- A local atheist and a national group that advocates for the strict separation of church and state have
sued the city to remove a large, white Christian cross at a public park where an 18th century Spanish Catholic mission
once stood.

In a lawsuit filed Wednesday in the Ninth U.S. District Court, resident Andrew Defaria and the Freedom From Religion
Foundation argue that the 14-foot granite cross is a "blatant religious symbol" that violates the First Amendment of
the Constitution and California law.

The cross stands at Memorial Cross Park, which sits at the intersection of Martin Avenue and De La Cruz Blvd. A local
civic club donated the cross in 1953 to mark the site of Santa Clara's second mission. Based in Wisconsin, Freedom From
Religion said it first complained to the city in 2012. The lawsuits names the city, Mayor Lisa Gillmor and council
members as defendants.
